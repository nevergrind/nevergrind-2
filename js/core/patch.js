		{text: "If a mob dies while you're casting a buff or a heal on a friendly target, your spell will no longer automatically cancel."},
		{text: "Fixed a bug where targeting party members was not automatically drawing the correct width of the target health bar."},
		{text: "Fixed the gray screen of doom. Maybe?"},
		{text: "Fixed a bug where your game would sometimes bug out if you deleted an item while walking into a new room."},
		{text: "The /help command's output was moved back to the chat log since it scrolls, again. You can also use basic filtering on it like /help group."},
		{text: "It's now totally impossible to die outside of combat from a DoT. You will soldier on with one hit point. Similarly, mobs cannot die if no party members are alive."},

		{text: 'Fixed a broken link to a harpy sound effect.'},
		{text: 'Your monitor will not longer attempt to maximize its size when entering 1920x1080 video mode.'},
		{text: 'Changed all mob classes\' casting rates for all skills. Only three mob classes, WAR, SHD, and CRU have the ability to Slam and it\'s at a much lower frequency.'},
